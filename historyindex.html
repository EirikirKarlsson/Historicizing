        <p>HTML 1.0 launched in 1991 along with the Web available to the public. This version of HTML developed as a hybrid of the earlier Standard Generalized Markup Language &lpar;SGML&rpar; developed in the mid&hyphen;80&apos;s. Tim Berners-Lee, while working at CERN, proposed this standardized hypertext system to simplify communication between members of global CERN teams. The original specifications created by Berner&hyphen;Lee only included 20 elements whose primary function was to allow document access to programmers.

          <p>HTML 2.0 was released in 1994 as the first official standard for HTML. It was during this period that personal and commercial web use explodes. While HTML 2.0 was the standard additional web features developed including Client-Side Image Maps which were document elements allowing the user to select an area of an image to access different network resources. Tables also were supported to improve the presentation and control over that type of information. Just prior to the release of HTML 2.0 and during its standard a number of web-browers developed including: Cello, Arena, Lyns, tkWWW, and Mosaic &lpar;which later became Netscape&rpar;.
