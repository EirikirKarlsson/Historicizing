        <p>HTML 1.0 launched in 1991 along with the Web available to the public. This version of HTML developed as a hybrid of the earlier Standard Generalized Markup Language &lpar;SGML&rpar; developed in the mid&hyphen;80&apos;s. Tim Berners-Lee, while working at CERN, proposed this standardized hypertext system to simplify communication between members of global CERN teams. The original specifications created by Berner&hyphen;Lee only included 20 elements whose primary function was to allow document access to programmers.

          <p>HTML 2.0 was released in 1994 as the first official standard for HTML. It was during this period that personal and commercial web use explodes. While HTML 2.0 was the standard additional web features developed including Client-Side Image Maps which were document elements allowing the user to select an area of an image to access different network resources. Tables also were supported to improve the presentation and control over that type of information. Just prior to the release of HTML 2.0 and during its standard a number of web-browers developed including: Cello, Arena, Lyns, tkWWW, and Mosaic &lpar;which later became Netscape&rpar;. During this HTML release the status of the elements discussed went unchanged. It was during this period that the first CSS specifications became officially recommended by the W3C. During this period, the Internet Explorer browers became the first to support Cascading Style Sheets &lpar;CSS&rpar;.

        <p>Initially code-named &quot;Wilbur&quot;&comma; HTML 3&period;2 became the standard in in 1997. This period was marked by heated compeition between Netscape, the leading browser of the time, and Internet Explorer. Each new Netscape version introduced elements and attributes that IE and other completing browsers attempted to duplicate. Because many of Netscape&apos;s tags were unspecified, they didn't perform as expected and much confusion resulted. In response, many of Netscape's tags, along with tags from competing browser vendors, were officially codified in HTML 3&period;2. There were some conspicuous omissions, however. The flashy, eye-catching &lt;marquee&gt; and &lt;blink&gt; attributes from Internet Explorer and Netscape respectively were left out of HTML 3.2 as a part of the negotiation process to reach an agreement on 3&period;2. This period was also marked by a conflict between those who felt that formatting attributes were changing HTML from an organizational language to one that decorates information. This conversation led directly to the further development  CSS language tests and standardization the following year. Also in 1998, Netscape lost the browser war to IE and was acquired by America Online.

        <p>Text for HTML 4&period;0, or Cougar, was recommended and published in December, 1997 and received final approval as HTML 4&period;01 two years later. This version also went further down the path of codifying browser tags begun in 3&period;2 but also deprecated many of Netscape's formatting tags, including those listed to the right, in favor of CSS&apos;s effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, 4&period;0 /4&period;1 embodied three main characteristics. First, it strictly enforced which deprecated tags could no longer be used. Second, it defined a transitional period for other deprecated elements-tags that were allowed to be used for a period until they, too, would be strictly forbidden. Thirdly, HTML 4&period;0 /4&period;1 defined &lt;frameset&gt; and &lt;frame&gt; would be the primary tools to display content indepedent of its container.<br/>
        </br>
        During the period of HTML 4&period;0 /4&period;1, CSS reached a critical moment. Until then, CSS had not been tested in all the available browsers. Eric Meyer and a group a volunteers created a test suite to ensure CSS would develop as a universally applicable formatting language. As a component, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid1">the Box Acid Test</a>, developed by Todd Farhner, established a baseline for CSS formatting operability across all browser vendors. The current version of the acid test can be viewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3">here</a>.

          <p> HTML5 is the product of an independent effort by a group called the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group &lpar;WHATWG&rpar; who developed a pragmatic new specification outside W3C procedure. Their efforts caused the W3C, who had developed the first version of eXtensible HTML &lpar;XHTML&rpar; and were developing the second version, to reconsider the future basis for web&hyphen;based markup languages. They decided that HTML would still be the future web language. XHTML 2 efforts were discontinued and HTML5 became the agreed upon specification. For the purposes of this project, HTML5 codified the obsolesence of transitionally deprecated tags under version 4.01.<br/></p>
          <br/>
          <p>
          With HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets &lpar;CSS&rpar; is the accepted method to describe how HTML elements are displayed. Some of the tags to the right are a few of a larger list to become obsolete in favor CSS&apos;s specificity and efficiency.
